# wap

Query lyrics from Cardi B's 2020 hit song "WAP" in Node.JS.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import wap from 'wap'

const myLyric = wap().random() // get a random lyric
const lyricArray = wap().array() // get an array of WAP lyrics
```

## Content Filter

Filter the lyrics for just clean ones. You can also filter for just the filthy ones ðŸ‘€

Each one returns another wap() object, so you can chain the calls together.

```typescript
import wap from 'wap'

const myLyric = wap().random() // get a random lyric
const lyricArray = wap().array() // get an array of WAP lyrics
```
