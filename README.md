# typescript-starter

A simple starter for Node TypeScript projects with tests, CI, and scripts.

## Usage

```typescript
import { sum } from 'typescript-starter'

sum(1, 5) // returns 6
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, implement it in TypeScript in the `src/` directory. Add a test file in `__tests__/` to make sure it works properly â€“ you can just copy one of the other testing files and substitute in your sorting algorithm.
